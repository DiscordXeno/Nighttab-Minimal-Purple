# Nighttab-Minimal-Purple
This is my nighttab config.
I made this using nighttabs built in tools, NightTab is a versatile tool to make custom startpages, and it can be found here: https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab

I used nightTab to make this, and i hope others can make variations of my config.
